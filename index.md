### DataScience-Capstone-Project
Problem Statement 

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases. The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. Dataset Description The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

Variables Description Pregnancies Number of times pregnant Glucose Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test BloodPressure Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) SkinThickness Triceps skinfold thickness (mm) Insulin Two hour serum insulin BMI Body Mass Index DiabetesPedigreeFunction Diabetes pedigree function Age Age in years Outcome Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0 Project Task: Week 1 Data Exploration:

Perform descriptive analysis. Understand the variables and their corresponding values. On the columns below, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value: • Glucose

• BloodPressure

• SkinThickness

• Insulin

• BMI

Visually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.

There are integer and float data type variables in this dataset. Create a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables.

Problem Statement

· Amazon is an online shopping website that now caters to millions of people everywhere. Over 34,000 consumer reviews for Amazon brand products like Kindle, Fire TV Stick and more are provided.

· The dataset has attributes like brand, categories, primary categories, reviews.title, reviews.text, and the sentiment. Sentiment is a categorical variable with three levels "Positive", "Negative", and "Neutral". For a given unseen data, the sentiment needs to be predicted.

· You are required to predict Sentiment or Satisfaction of a purchase based on multiple features and review text.
